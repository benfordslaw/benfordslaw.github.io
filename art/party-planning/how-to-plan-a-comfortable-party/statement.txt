<i>hand-drawn booklet</i><br>
First in a series of party planning guides, this booklet supposes comfort as a possible party theme. It engages the challenge of how a constructed party environment could center the attendeesâ€™ comfort. It also investigates the relationship between comfort and discomfort, questioning whether it would even be worth planning such a party.
