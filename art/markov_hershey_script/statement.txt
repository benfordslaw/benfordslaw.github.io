I’m a big fan of Hershey fonts, particularly script simplex. It takes me back to being a kid and learning cursive, which is a big part of the aesthetics of early learning. This project is structured around the standard of a hershey font, but deviates from it heavily. It treads the line between personal and public, illegible and legible, communicative and secret.

What if words aren’t constituted by characters, but by points? We can go beyond the character level, then, in markov text generation. In order to do this, I got the coordinates of every alphabetical bigram (“aa”, “ab”, …, “zy”, “zz”) using my single-line-hershey tool. I turned these into a series of vectors, each pointing from the previous point to the current one. I was then able to use this array of series of coordinates in a markov chain, using an order of three coordinates (x, y, x_next).  I then generated a string of vectors and wrote a function to walk through them, leaving vertices behind. The result is something that looks like degraded handwriting.
