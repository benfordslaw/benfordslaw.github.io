How would we connect with others in a future without the internet? Would we? <br>
I want to care. I also want to be cared for. I don't see that changing in the next 100 years. After all, we tell our loves that they will stay our loves until the end of time. <br>

Who would we spend our time with? Each other? <br>
Every now and then I'll look out my window see Larry through his window sitting on his staircase talking to his kids. Every now and then I'll wonder what he's talking about. <br>

Would we be lonely? How would we deal with it? Would we? <br>
I want you to ask for what you need. I want to feel like I can too, like
"Could I ask you for something?" or "Can I ask a huge favor of you?"  <br>

How would I? <br>
I know you can say no but I also know it can sometimes be hard to say no. I sometimes feel like putting it in text is the best way to ask for things because it's easier to say no to a sentence than to a person. <br>

What would I ask for? Anything? Everything? Or nothing at all? <br>
It's sometimes hard for me to admit to myself that I actually need something. I guess in that way it's still worth asking for things I think no one can give. In another way, the more you ask for, the more you can get. <br>
